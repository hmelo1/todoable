# Todoable

Library wrapper to use the Todoable API.

Gem Link: https://rubygems.org/gems/todoable

## Pre-Requisite
Install the gem using bundler

Add to GemFile:
```
gem 'todoable', '~> 1.0', git: 'https://github.com/hmelo1/todoable.git'
```
Run a good ol'fashioned bundle install

## Dependencies
```
Rest-Client
Bundler
Rspec
Rake
```

## Clases and Modules

`Todoable::User` < Represents the User currently logged in.

`Todoable::List` < Represents the Lists of Todo Lists

`Todoable::Item` < Represents the individual items going into the Todo List

## Adjustments needed
* Currently there are no tests running for the items class. Was unable to figure out how to properly test them within the alloted few hours. 
* Readability within tests could be improved.
* Some error capturing for errors. RestClient handles some, but more error capturing is needed.
